      "Come celebrate the start of summer on the quirky little one-way street that leads to Historic Downtown Burlington! The Loop (the 100 block of E Chestnut St) will be closed to traffic for what's guaranteed to be a fun-filled day of live music, family games and activities, business tours, and all-day food, beverages and craft beer. The Royal Canine will be hosting an “adopt a plushie” activity. Kids can choose from a variety of stuffed “pets” and collars and will be able to decorate their carriers. They will also receive an “adoption certificate” and pet care checklist / chore chart.",

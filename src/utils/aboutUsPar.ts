    p: "The Royal Canine is a self-service dog wash boutique that offers a convenient alternative to washing your pet at home! There are two state-of-the-art dog wash machines that run 15-minute programs. This includes shampoo, conditioner, leave-in flea shampoo, and low and high blow dry time. Additional time can be added in 3-minute increments, and the timer can also be paused if needed. Towels, aprons, and treats are also provided – all you need to do is show up with your dirty fur family member!"

    p: "Instead of struggling to bend over your own tub, you can bathe your pet in our waist-high tubs – and the best part is, there is no mess to clean up at home! Our wash stations are equipped with ramps for easy entrance/exit of the tubs. The wash programs also have a “sanitize” feature to disinfect the tubs before and after each use. Our facility is cleaned regularly, and sanitation is very important to us! For safety measures, each of the wash bays are separated with half-walls and doors to keep pets separated."

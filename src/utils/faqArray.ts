    question: "Payment at the Machine:",
    answer: [
      "Payment can be made with cash (exact change only), prepaid wash tokens, card or “touch to pay” at the terminals on the machines.",
      "A $15 wash MUST be purchased to start the wash cycle. (If less than 15 minutes is purchased to start, the machine will not activate. If this happens, add & pay for additional time in 3-minute increments until 15 minutes is reached – then the wash will start.)",
      "To add additional time, you must present additional payment DURING the 99 second countdown. DO NOT add 3 minutes after the countdown is done and the screen shows “00:00 / Start $15 > 15:00 min”. If you miss the countdown window, and need more time, another 15 minutes must be added for the wash to re-start.",

    question: "Tub “Disinfect” Feature:",
    answer: [
      "The wash tubs can be sanitized before each use, but pups should NOT be inside during.",
      "Upon payment, a message on the screen will ask if you would like to disinfect. Click “Yes/Disinfect”. (Green button/2nd from bottom) Confirm your dog is out of the tub and click “Yes” again. This does not count towards your wash time.",
      "The wash tubs should also be sanitized after each wash. There is a 99 second countdown after the 15 minutes is up. (A “chirp” will sound right before the timer runs out.)  Then you will be prompted to sanitize. (Same directions as before the wash – see bullet 1 above.) You only have 30 seconds to confirm during this time or the prompt will disappear.",
      "If you miss the window to sanitize at the end of the wash, you can still do so by pressing the “Yes/Disinfect” button quickly 3 times in a row.",

    question: "Bathing in the Tubs:",
    answer: [
      "The water temperature is not adjustable but has been pre-set to a safe and comfortable temperature.",
      "There are chains at either end of the tubs that can be attached to a collar. Alternatively, there are black nylon choke collars attached to the chains that may be used instead.",
      "Work down the row of buttons through the cycle. They do not progress to the next automatically – they need to be pressed manually.",
      "The liquids are metered and come out through the hose nozzle at the correct ratio. If no water is coming out of the hose, press the silver button on the sprayer to turn it on.",
      "The spray pattern can be changed (if the power is too strong or weak) by rotating the end of the sprayer nozzle.",
      "You can choose to use “regular” shampoo, “fleawash” (also a shampoo), or both.",
      "The conditioner is not a leave-in treatment and should be rinsed thoroughly.",
      "To use your own shampoo, leave the program on the “rinse” mode.",

    question: "Dryers/Towels:",
    answer: [
      "The dryers make some dogs anxious. Stay close to prevent them from jumping out of the tubs.",
      "Our “happy hoodies” and CBD treats are a HUGE help in calming them during drying!",
      "Please only use ONE towel per paid wash and place it in the “dirty” laundry bin after.",

    question: "Pro-Tips:",
    answer: [
      "“Stop/Pause” is the bottom button on the row. Press it to stop the timer if necessary. Click any another button to re-start the cycle.",
      "Some dogs are confused by the ramps and don’t want to use them. Entice them by holding a treat at the top of the ramp!",
      "Aprons are hanging toward the back of the shop. Feel free to use them to protect your clothing!",
      "When there is no street parking in front of the shop, we recommend looking in the Loop, the public lot behind the Loop, or the city parking garage.",

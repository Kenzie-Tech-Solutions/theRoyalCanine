    question: "PAYMENT AT THE MACHINE",
    answer: [
      "Payment can be made with cash (exact change only), prepaid wash tokens, card or “touch to pay” at the terminals on the machines.",
      "A $15 wash MUST be purchased to start the wash cycle. (If less than 15 minutes is purchased to start, the machine will not activate. If this happens, add & pay for additional time in 3-minute increments until 15 minutes is reached – then the wash will start.)",
      "To add additional time, you must present additional payment DURING the 99 second countdown. DO NOT add 3 minutes after the countdown is done and the screen shows “00:00 / Start $15 > 15:00 min”. If you miss the countdown window, and need more time, another 15 minutes must be added for the wash to re-start.",

    question: "TUB “DISINFECT” FEATURE",
    answer: [
      "The wash tubs can be sanitized before each use, but pups should NOT be inside during.",
      "Upon payment, a message on the screen will ask if you would like to disinfect. Click “Yes/Disinfect”. (Green button/2nd from bottom) Confirm your dog is out of the tub and click “Yes” again. This does not count towards your wash time.",
      "The wash tubs should also be sanitized after each wash. There is a 99 second countdown after the 15 minutes is up. (A “chirp” will sound right before the timer runs out.)  Then you will be prompted to sanitize. (Same directions as before the wash – see bullet 1 above.) You only have 30 seconds to confirm during this time or the prompt will disappear.",
      "If you miss the window to sanitize at the end of the wash, you can still do so by pressing the “Yes/Disinfect” button quickly 3 times in a row.",

    question: "BATHING YOUR PET IN OUR TUBS",
    answer: [
      "The water temperature is not adjustable but has been pre-set to a safe and comfortable temperature.",
      "There are chains at either end of the tubs that can be attached to a collar. Alternatively, there are black nylon choke collars attached to the chains that may be used instead.",
      "Work down the row of buttons through the cycle. They do not progress to the next automatically and will need to be pressed manually to move on.",
      "The liquids are metered and come out through the hose nozzle at the correct ratio. If no water is coming out of the hose, press the silver button on the sprayer to turn it on.",
      "The spray pattern can be changed (if the power is too strong or weak) by rotating the end of the sprayer nozzle.",
      "You can choose to use “regular” shampoo, “fleawash” (also a shampoo), or both.",
      "The conditioner is not a leave-in treatment and should be rinsed thoroughly.",
      "To use your own shampoo, leave the program on the “rinse” mode.",

    question: "DRYERS/TOWELS",
    answer: [
      "The dryers make some dogs anxious. Stay close to prevent them from jumping out of the tubs.",
      "Please only use ONE towel per paid wash and place it in the “dirty” laundry bin after.",
      "Towel drying your dog by hand after washing (but before drying) will help cut down on the amount of dryer time needed. (Paws get especially wet and are hard to get with the dryer so don’t forgot to towel dry them well also!)",
      "Our “happy hoodies” and CBD treats are VERY helpful in calming your pup during drying (and in many other situations)!",

    question: "PRO-TIPS",
    answer: [
      "“Stop/Pause” is the bottom button on the row (lit up in red). Press it to stop the timer if necessary. Click any another button to re-start the cycle.",
      "Some dogs don’t want to use the ramps. You can try to entice them by holding a treat at the top of the ramp! ",
      "If you have a very large (and possibly strong willed) dog, a 2nd set of hands is suggested to help get them up the ramp and in the tub.",
      "Aprons are hanging toward the back of the shop. Feel free to use them to protect your clothing!",
      "When there is no street parking in front of the shop, we recommend looking in the Loop, the public lot behind the Loop, or the city parking garage.",
